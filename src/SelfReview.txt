Through adapting, we realized that we could have abstracted code a lot more. Definitely numerous
classes that existed that could existed first as interfaces. Even if it's not minimizing code
duplication, interfacing code is super helpful for future design choices. This goes for things like
our Grid or our players (which we did interface). Similarly, we didn't have a controller interface,
as our providers did. Jumping in immediately with the class definitely made adapting controllers
harder.
