  Design Critique
    The new interfaces provided for the Three Trios game, such as ThreeTriosGUIView and
  ViewListener, are designed to facilitate a clear separation of concerns between the view and
  controller components. This design choice enhances modularity, allowing different views to be
  integrated with the same underlying game logic. The interfaces are flexible enough to support
  various implementations, which is beneficial for extending or replacing components without
  disrupting the entire system.
  Separating Players into HumanPlayer and MachinePlayer may be useful, that way we don't have to
  keep machinePlayer behavior in humanPlayers
  ViewListener and TriosController share the same methods: can use click listener to abstract or
  even just implement the interfaces within each other

  Implementation Critique
    The implementation of these interfaces in the adapter classes was straightforward, thanks to
  their well-defined methods. However, some challenges arose due to differences in how events are
  handled in the existing code compared to the new interfaces. For instance, integrating methods
  like playerChanged() and invalidMove() required careful consideration of how these events are
  processed within the existing ThreeTriosGameView. The adapter pattern effectively bridged these
  differences, demonstrating its utility in integrating disparate systems.

  Documentation Critique
    The documentation provided with the new interfaces was generally clear and concise, outlining the
  purpose and expected behavior of each method. This clarity was crucial in understanding how to
  adapt existing code to align with the new design. However, additional context on how these
  interfaces interact with other components would have been helpful, particularly for methods like
  addInteractionListener, which involves multiple layers of interaction between the view and
  controller.

  Design/Code Limitations and Suggestions
     One limitation observed was the lack of direct support for some specific interactions in the new
  interfaces, such as handling game-over scenarios or turn switches without creating new methods.
  This required creative use of existing methods like showMessage to convey state changes to users.
  To address this, future iterations could include more comprehensive event handling capabilities
  within the interfaces themselves, reducing reliance on workarounds. Additionally, providing
  examples or guidelines on integrating these interfaces with typical game architectures could
  streamline the adaptation.
